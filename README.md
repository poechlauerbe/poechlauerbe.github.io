# My Page

This is the repository for my private website

At the moment this site is under construction.

I use this site to gain more knowledge with:
- HTML, CSS & Javascript
- Github Actions

The live Site you find [here](https://poechlauerbe.github.io)

If you want to create your own site:
- create repository YourUsername.github.io
- put in some basic HTML code
- find your site here: YourUsername.github.io
- have fun!
